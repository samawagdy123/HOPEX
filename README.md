We are working on creating a reverse vending machine (RVM) prototype that connects to a mobile App to help
Users receive solid waste from them (aluminum-plastic) and replace it with
points on the app they can later exchange these points with Cash Back or discounts from
restaurants.

We dealt with ultrasonic sensors, servo motors, LEDs, LCD, and microcontroller(ESP32)
